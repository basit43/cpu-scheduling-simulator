# CPU Scheduling Simulator

A modular CPU Scheduling Simulator written in Python to explore and understand core Operating System scheduling algorithms through time-based simulation, metric analysis, and experimental performance evaluation.

This project models how an operating system decides which process runs on the CPU and in what order. It provides:

- Time-based Gantt chart simulation
- Detailed performance metrics
- Random workload generation
- Experimental comparison of algorithms
- Visualization using matplotlib

---

## 🚀 Implemented Algorithms

The simulator currently supports:

- **First Come First Serve (FCFS)** – Non-preemptive  
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)** – Non-preemptive  
- **Round Robin (RR)** – Preemptive (time-sliced)

Each algorithm is implemented independently in a modular structure for clarity, scalability, and future research-level extensions.

## 📊 Time-Based Gantt Chart Simulation

The simulator generates a Gantt Chart timeline for each scheduling algorithm.

The Gantt chart visually represents:

- Execution order  
- Start and end times  
- Preemption (for Round Robin)  
- Context switching behavior  

Example output:
